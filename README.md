cta_analytics
=============

Code to scrape and analyze bus location data from the Chicago transit
authority bustracker API.

To get this code to talk to the api you need to get your own [api
key](http://www.transitchicago.com/developers/bustracker.aspx).

This code is very experimental and I may break any part of it at
anytime.  If you use this in anyway, please contact me.



Installation
------------

Copy `config.py.template` to `config.py` and fill in your API key.  There is currently
no installation procedure, I run the code in-place.
